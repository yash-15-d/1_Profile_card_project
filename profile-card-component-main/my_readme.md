Styling

The CSS code provides basic styling for the profile card component. It includes the following features:

    Centered layout with a minimum height of 450 pixels.
    Rounded corners and a background pattern for the card container.
    White background for the details section.
    Profile picture with a circular shape and a border.
    Horizontal line separator.
    Statistics displayed in a row with equal spacing.

Background Images

The profile card component uses two background images to create a visually appealing background. The images are located in the ./images directory:

    bg-pattern-bottom.svg: This image is positioned at the bottom of the background.
    bg-pattern-top.svg: This image is positioned at the top of the background.

Responsive Design

The profile card component is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. It uses the @media rule to apply specific styles when the width of the viewport is less than 400 pixels. In this case, the width of the card container is reduced to 320 pixels.

Feel free to modify the styles and adjust the responsive breakpoints to fit your project's requirements.
